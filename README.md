# addOnButton_Manual
adding a button/action to an existing button

the button does a couple of things, and i've gotten them to work

i'm just including the part here that i'm struggling with

i need the button to update the time, which it does


But I also need it to update a field called "Need_Special_Pricing2__c".

the field is a picklist with 'No' being the default

I need it to update to 'Yes'

('No' and 'Yes' are the API names)
